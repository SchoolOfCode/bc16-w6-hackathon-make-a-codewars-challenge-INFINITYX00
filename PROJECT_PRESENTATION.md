Kata instructions
Hello Challenger!
I often never know when I should wear my jacket, I always wear it at the wrong time! So please help me by writing called `coatOrNoCoat`
It should take in a single number argument of `temp`.
The function should be able to handle any numbers no matter how big or small.
If the temp is less than 20, return "it's cold out you should wear a coat"
If the temp is greater than or equal 20 return "it's warm out you don't need a coat"

MVP1: Create a Kata.
The challenger should write a function to return a string based on the weather and if jacket should be worn.

- Create different test cases to ensure the function is correct.

* Temperature less than or equal to 20
* Temperature greater than 20
* Zero temperature
* Negative temperature
* Large temperature
* Decimal temperature (rounded down)
* Decimal temperature (rounded up)
* Non-numeric input
* Missing input
* Very high temperature
