Kata instructions

Hello, I often never know when I should wear my jacket, I always wear it at the wrong time! So please help me by writing a function called `coatOrNoCoat`
It should take in a single number argument of `temp`.
The function should be able to handle any numbers no matter how big or small.
If the temp is less than 20, return "it's cold out you should wear a coat"
If the temp is greater than or equal 20 return "it's warm out you don't need a coat"
