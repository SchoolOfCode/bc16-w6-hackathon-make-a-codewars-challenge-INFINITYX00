Kata instructions

Hello, I often never know when I should wear my jacket, I always wear it at the wrong time! So please help me by writing a function called `coatOrNoCoat`
It should take in a single number argument of `temp`.
The function should be able to handle any numbers no matter how big or small.
If the temp is less than 20, return "it's cold out you should wear a coat"
If the temp is greater than or equal 20 return "it's warm out you don't need a coat"

MVP:
Write tests based on the comments in main.js
Write code to pass these tests, start simple
Write the solution by creating a function to return a string based on the weather and if coat should be worn
Check the solution passes the tests
Remove solution code when tests work

Stretch goals:
Make harder levels of the kata to differentiate between learners skill levels
User to modify function to handle multiple temperature values at once

Brainstorming the idea!
Function Purpose: This function needs to help the user determine whether they should a coat based on the weather.
Input: Single numeric argument(integers, decimals, negative)

Output: Return a string message to indicate whether to wear a coat. If temperature is less than 20, then wear a coat. If temperature is greater than or equal to 20, then don't wear a coat.

Edge cases: Handle edge cases, zero, negative, very high or very low temperatures.
Non-numeric and missing input should be handled.

Test cases:

- Temperature less than or equal to 20
- Temperature greater than 20
- Zero temperature
- Negative temperature
- Large temperature
- Decimal temperature (rounded down)
- Decimal temperature (rounded up)
- Non-numeric input
- Missing input
- Very high temperature

Reflections

What went well:

- Planning and testing
- Discussing ideas and making team decisions
- Communication within the team

How I could improve

- Get to level 300 on codewars
- Stay relaxed even when things go wrong
- Improve the kata by making harder levels
